                    <p> The Internet itself was a superhighway of information built on network infrastructure that connected computers and devices across the world. But, with the inception of Web Browser technology individuals could easily navigate this infrastructure by typing a destination in the web address bar, which would then take them to a “website” (Mozilla, 2021). </p>

                    <h4> The Father of Web Browsers</h4>
                    <p> The evolution of computer hardware and software has had a short history, but in that time many major advancements occurred since the inception of the Internet in the 1960s. Due to the cold war’s rising tensions, world governments funded many scientific and technical ventures. The earliest form of Internet was known as ARPANet, which was created in 1962 by a scientist named J.C.R Licklider for the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA). </p>
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 10%;"> However, this version of the Internet was still difficult to navigate. It wasn’t designed for the everyday citizen, but mostly for Governments and researchers to exchange information through databases (History.com Editors, 2024). It was not until the creation of the WorldWideWeb (later named “Nexus”), by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, that individuals could navigate the Internet more easily through a “Web Browser”.</p>
