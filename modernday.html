                <h3>The Fall of Internet Explorer</h3>

                <p>
                The modern era of Browsers started with the eventual death of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer's market share dropped from 90% to about 60% by 2006 (Statista , 2022). This happened due to a lack of change in IE. IE in 2008 operated almost identically to when it did in 1998. Many users complained that it was too slow, failed to comply with web standards set by the W3C counsel, and frequently missed updates (Smith, 2021). This, in combination with Microsoft’s failed antitrust case (Míra Podorský, 2023) caused individuals to slowly lose interest in IE. In fact, it was because of these flaws in Internet Explorer that new browser companies began to form.

                <h3>The Mozilla Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        After becoming open source in 1998, former Netscape employees began the Mozilla project. Mozilla’s intent was to not only improve the Netscape code, but to partner with the community to allow for more choice in the browser market. A variety of browsers and development tools were developed and made open source by the community during this time (Mozilla, 2013). Mozilla also helped to standardize Javascript across web browsers by partnering with an independent standards organization known as ECMA International. The result of this standardization was the establishment of the core language of JavaScript: ECMAScript (mdn web docs, 2025). By 2002, the Mozilla foundation released Mozilla 1.0, a new browser with many improvements to its GUI, email client, and other included applications. Over 90% of the market share still belonged to Internet Explorer, but slowly Mozilla and other new browsers started to come to the mainstream.

                <h3>Google Chrome</h3>
                    <p>
                        One such browser, developed in 2008 by Google, was Google Chrome. The main goal of Chrome was to provide users with a fast and simple browser that enhanced viewing space and minimized clutter. However, the key difference between Chrome and IE was how their architecture was built. Chrome operated on a “multi-process model”, meaning that each tab in the browser ran as a separate process. This was unlike IE, which used a single process for all tabs. This was highly inefficient because if one tab crashed in IE, then the whole browser would go down. Chrome’s multi-process model ensured that even if one tab crashed, the browser itself would still be able to operate.

                <h3>Google Chrome: Security and Extensions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chrome also had a larger emphasis on security. By isolating each tab as a separate process, it reduced the potential damage from a malactor/exploit. Chrome also featured frequent updates with security patches and enhancements. In the decade that Chrome launched, Google released over seventy updates, compared to the four updates released by Microsoft for Internet Explorer (Smith, 2021). Finally, Chrome focused more on the user experience than IE with features like incognito mode, and automatic updates. One such user feature was Chrome's support for extensions. Extensions allowed browsers to enhance functionality, by enabling more features that are not natively supported (i.e Ad blockers or password managers). IE offered very minimal third-party extensions support, but Chrome allowed developers to create a wide variety of extensions that could be hosted on the Chrome Web Store.

                <h3>The Rise of Mobile Devices</h3>
                    <p>
                        While Chrome had a lot of success in the beginning, its true rise to prominence did not come until mobile devices became more popular. Android devices are the most used mobile devices in the world, and Google was able to make chrome the default web browser for most of these devices. As more individuals adopted mobile phones, Google Chrome became a household name (UMATechnology, 2025). As of January 2025, Chrome has 65% of the browser market share, followed by Apple’s Safari, and finally Microsoft edge (IE’s replacement) (SOAX, 2024).
