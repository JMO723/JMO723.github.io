            <h2> What were The Browser Wars?</h2>

                <h3>Internet Explorer vs. Netscape Navigator</h3>

                <p>
                Internet Explorer fueled new competition in the browser market, but the “first shot” of the war came about in 1995. Netscape started selling public shares of its stock for $28, by the end of the first day the stock value shot up to $70 and reached a market value of nearly $2 billion. This caught the attention of Microsoft, a company who had the most dominant personal computer operating system. Soon after these developments, Microsoft created Internet Explorer 1.0 and bundled it with their latest OS for free (Andrew Beattie, 2023).  
                </p>

                <p>
                This was unprecedented, because at the time Netscape was selling its browser (Netscape Navigator 2.0) for $49 (CNET, 1996). Microsoft developed a lot of its browser technologies in response to what Netscape Navigator did. Whenever Netscape released something new, Microsoft would quickly recreate it for Internet Explorer. This can be seen best in the scripting languages for web development both companies released.   
                </p>

                <p>
                Scripting languages “Are languages designed for specific runtime environments to provide additional functions, integrate complex systems, and communicate with other programming languages” (Coursera, 2025). Netscape Navigator released its JavaScript language in 1995. JavaScript enabled the generation of dynamic webpage content (i.e. Real-time update, User interactions, client-side processing, etc). Soon after JavaScript, Microsoft released JScript in retaliation. JScript did much of the same as JavaScript but included additional commands and features that were exclusive to Jscript. Even though these scripting languages were similar, they would look dramatically different depending on the web browser. JavaScript would not look good on Internet Explorer and vice versa.
                </p>

                <p>
                This created an even larger divide between Netscape and Internet Explorer users (Chapman, 2019). By the late 90s it was clear that Internet Explorer would come out the victor in the “Browser Wars”, with its market share peaking at 90%. Netscape could not compete, especially with Microsoft packaging Internet Explorer with Windows and even making deals with other companies (Dell, Compact, IBM) to pre-install Internet Explorer on new devices. Thus in 1998, Netscape became open source, ending the first “Browser Wars”.
