                The early days of web browser technology came in 1989, with the invention of Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s WorldWideWeb (WWW). Berner-Lee developed this technology at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) to “Meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world”. In fact, the very first website (also developed by CERN in 1991) was dedicated to Berner-Lee’s World Wide Web Project (Cern, 2019).

                The first web browser had a very simple menu and was limited. While you could access images, they would not display inline with the text and instead open in a new window. Lastly, there was also no way for individuals to play audio in the web browser without external plugins.
